"C:/Programs/Julia-1.9.3/bin".}

\item{install_libraries}{\verb{[logical]} \cr If \code{FALSE}, Julia will be
launched and the required libraries will be loaded without installing them.
If \code{TRUE} (default), the libraries will be (re-)installed in Julia.}

\description{
This function starts a Julia session from R and imports the \code{ConScape} and \code{Circuitscape} library
to be used from R. It assumes that Julia is already installed in the system
and the path to its executables is given as the \code{julia_path} argument.
The first time the function is ran, it is best to set \code{install_libraries = TRUE}
to install the libraries in Julia.
